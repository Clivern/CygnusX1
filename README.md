Explanation
--
What's at the tip of this interstellar jet?  First let's consider the jet: it is being expelled by a star system just forming and is cataloged as Herbig-Haro 49 (HH 49).  The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.  The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.  The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.  This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49's tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.  The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.   Jump Around the Universe: Random APOD Generator
