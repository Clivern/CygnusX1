Explanation
--
Sometimes, the surface of our Sun seems to dance. In the middle of 2012, for example, NASA's Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamic Observatory spacecraft imaged an impressive prominence that seemed to perform a running dive roll like an acrobatic dancer.  The dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the featured time-lapse video covering about three hours. A looping magnetic field directed the flow of hot plasma on the Sun. The scale of the   dancing prominence is huge -- the entire Earth would easily fit under the flowing   arch of hot gas.  A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), expelling hot gas into the Solar System.  The energy mechanism that creates a solar prominence is still a topic of research.  Like in 2012, this year the Sun's surface is again quite active and features many filaments and prominences.
